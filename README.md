## Description:


The first most important, file I create is `index.html`, which is the default entry point for any web application. All of our subsequent work will build on this initial starting point. The file suffix `.html` refers to **HTML**, or **Hypertext Markup Language**. HTML allows us to format webpages and text in a similar way to how a word processor formats documents and the text inside them. However, the biggest difference between HTML and a word processor is the ability to link between any document that's on the web, anywhere in the world. This is the "hypertext" in HTML.

Though HTML is enough to create a simple website, it falls a bit short in the design department. So we'll  add color, fonts, and element positioning by adding **CSS** (**Cascading Style Sheets**) to our HTML files to make them visually dynamic. In the next unit, we'll learn CSS frameworks that can expedite our development process.

In this repository, the Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc. website is refactored to be more accessible. The code was improved for accessibiltiy without changing the features or function of the website. This was done by using semantic html tags and adding alt tags to all images; the source code was modified also to remove all duplicate elements and to make it simplified and efficient.

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

To impress clients for example, I make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
